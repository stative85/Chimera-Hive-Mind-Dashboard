Alright—here’s a full **polished README.md** draft for your **Chimera Hive Mind Dashboard** repo. This keeps it professional for GitHub visibility but still has the edge of your BuilderOps vibe. You can drop this right into your README:

# 🐉 Chimera Hive Mind Dashboard

A modular dashboard for orchestrating **multi-agent intelligence**.
The Chimera Hive Mind Dashboard unifies swarm telemetry, neural feedback, and distributed system monitoring into a single control surface.

## ✨ Features

* 📡 **Live Node Telemetry** – Track real-time status, activity, and comms of agents or services
* 🔀 **Swarm Visualization** – See emergent behavior and collective decision-making patterns unfold
* 🧩 **Modular Architecture** – Plug in custom data sources, simulation layers, or agent types
* 🕸 **Signal Filtering** – Separate signal from noise for sharper coordination
* ⏱ **Event Replay** – Log, review, and analyze swarm decisions over time

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* npm or yarn
* A valid Gemini API key (or other configured backend)

### Installation

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Chimera-Hive-Mind-Dashboard.git
cd Chimera-Hive-Mind-Dashboard

# install dependencies
npm install

# set your API key (example: Gemini)
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your dashboard will be live at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📚 Use Cases

* Multi-agent AI simulations
* Swarm robotics & hive-mind research
* Distributed systems monitoring & orchestration
* Creative experiments in emergent intelligence

---

## 🛠 Roadmap

* [ ] Expand visualization modules (heatmaps, neural link graphs)
* [ ] Add support for multiple backend APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, local LLMs)
* [ ] Persistent storage for swarm state replays
* [ ] Plugins for robotics / IoT integration
